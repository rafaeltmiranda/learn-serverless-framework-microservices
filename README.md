https://www.udemy.com/course/serverless-framework/?ranMID=39197&ranEAID=O*yDCFDQTmY&ranSiteID=O.yDCFDQTmY-pbBV5G_YA1uxwpEcfTPfUg&LSNPUBID=O*yDCFDQTmY

In this course, I made an Auctions application, where you can login, create an auction, bid at an auction and upload a picture. Also it will close the ended auctions automaticly and send an email for both seller and highest bid bidder. Only backend was made.

The porpose of this course is to understand how serverless functions work and how can I create a fully working application using serverless backend.
